Libraries: vector, standard atmosphere, Runge-Kutta method, mesh(for quick solution of equations).
The mesh library emulates n-dimensional arrays from a regular array, which increases data locality.
Examples of the use of libraries in the case of solving the diffusion equation and the wave equation are given.
